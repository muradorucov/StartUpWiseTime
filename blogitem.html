                                difficult for beginners,

                                in languages like C that don’t have build-in support for lists.</p>

                            <p>Learning to program means learning how to solve problems using code. Conceptually it is
                                not
                                very difficult to
                                write a program that solves a problem that you can solve yourself. The skill you need to
                                acquire is thinking
                                very precisely about how you solve the problem and breaking it down into steps that are
                                so
                                simple that a
                                computer can execute them. I encourage you to first solve a few instances of a problem
                                by
                                hand and think about
                                what you did to find the solution. For example if the task is sorting lists, sort some
                                short
                                lists yourself.</p>
                            <p>A reasonable method would be to find the smallest element, write it down and cross it out
                                of
                                the original list
                                and repeat this process until you have sorted the whole list. Then you have to teach the
                                computer 1) how to find
                                the smallest element, 2) how to write it down, 3) how to cross it out, and wrap this in
                                a
                                loop. Then continue
                                this task breakdown process until you’re confident you know how to write the necessary
                                program.</p>
                            <h3>Benefits Of ASync/Await In Programming</h3>
                            <p>To make good progress in your programming task, you need to test your work as early and
                                as
                                thoroughly as
                                possible. Everybody makes mistakes while programming and finding mistakes in programs
                                consumes a very large part
                                of a programmer’s work-day. Finding a problem in a small and easy piece of code is much
                                simpler than trying to

                            <p>This is why you should try to test each sub task you identified during your
                                task-breakdown by
                                itself. Only after
                                you’re confident that each part works as you expect you can attempt to plug them
                                together.
                                Make sure you test
                                the complete program as well, errors can creep in in the way the different parts
                                interact.
                                You should try to
                                automate your tests. The easier it is to test your program, the freer you are in
                                experimenting with changes.</p>
